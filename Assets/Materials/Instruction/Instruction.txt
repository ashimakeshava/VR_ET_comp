## BEGINNING    (Welcome)

Welcome to our experiment.
This experiment consists of 10 small tasks that will repeat six times. 
Before each task you will be shown instructions.
At the beginning of the experiment 
and before each block, we will calibrate the eye-tracker. 
At each instruction screen you can take a break for as long as you want.
